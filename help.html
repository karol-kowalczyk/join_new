    <h3>What is Join?</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="jblue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management
      tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of
      their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

      <br /><br />Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly
      effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
      maximize efficiency (or flow).
      <span class="jblue">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban
      to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive,
      visual interface.

      <br /><br />It is important to note that
      <span class="jblue">Join</span> is designed as an educational
      exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we
      strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
      guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other
      aspects of quality regarding <span class="jblue">Join</span>.

    <h3 class="">How to use it</h3>
    <p>
      Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
      <span class="jblue">Join</span>:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When you log in to <span class="jblue">Join</span>, you'll find a
        default board. This board represents your project and contains
        four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
        "Done".
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Creating Contacts</h4> In <span class="jblue">Join</span>,
        you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
        "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
        required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
        tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4> Adding Cards</h4> Now that you've added your contacts,
        you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
        Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new
        card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name,
        description, due date, assignees, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Moving Cards</h4> As the task moves from one stage to
        another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
        dropping the card from one list to another.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Deleting Cards</h4> Once a task is completed, you can
        either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
        will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
        when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible. Remember that
        using <span class="jblue">Join</span> effectively requires
        consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
        reflects the current state of your project. Have more questions
        about <span class="jblue">Join</span>? Feel free to contact us at:
